# User Localization Visualization Tool

This project is to create a visual map of users which includes:
1) Web page where users can register with their information (username, name, password, US address).
2) Database that holds user data along with their lat/long geocode.
3) Frontend interface for users to login and edit their own information.
4) Map to display location of users.
6) Online User data which shows which users are online on the map.
